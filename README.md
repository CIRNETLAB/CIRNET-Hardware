# net-Circuit-Hardware

Independent `netcircuit-hardware-service==0.1.1`, Python >=3.11. The `hardware_service` namespace owns local-only Hardware RPC 2.0, virtual/physical stations and private FPGA transport. Runtime consumes exact `netcircuit-contracts==1.0.1` and `netcircuit-simulator==0.2.0` wheels. No API implementation or sibling checkout is needed. Artifacts remain LOCAL_UNPUBLISHED until publication is separately authorized.

Canonical [Lab-First v3.1 architecture](https://github.com/net-Circuit-Remote/net-Circuit-Remote/blob/0d038c7aed15798696223558b4e58f5ffe926aa9/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [physical safety authority](https://github.com/net-Circuit-Remote/net-Circuit-Remote/blob/0d038c7aed15798696223558b4e58f5ffe926aa9/docs/PHYSICAL_LAB_SAFETY.md) and approved M0 remain owned by Remote. Safety, topology and correctness are independent. Safe unknown or mismatched components do not become unsafe by identity alone.

Physical Start requires fresh scan/safety, a matching executable station/experiment plan, observed endpoint/resource coverage, applied routing, guarded power and armed capture. Missing driver reports OFFLINE/unavailable, zero slots/channels and `hardware_applied=false`. Serial/USB-SPI adapters remain unavailable placeholders. Test drivers, software/RTL gates and synthetic captures establish no electrical readiness, hardware ABI, ADC/DAC/AFE, SDRAM or physical timing guarantee. Remote owns admission, persisted leases/quarantine, capture storage and safe-release acknowledgment.

Virtual legacy digital execution uses independent per-experiment sessions and bounded spawned workers. Current Logic Analyzer has four channels; Scope/Generator have zero. `NETCIRCUIT_SIMULATION_BACKEND=legacy` is the default. Each station snapshots its backend; compiled identity survives environment changes and worker boundaries. Reserved `ngspice` remains unavailable without fallback. Set `NETCIRCUIT_SIMULATION_WORKERS` identically in API and Hardware (default 4, positive integer). RPC reserves four additional control threads. Stop/reset invalidates pending generation results; shutdown waits for owned workers.

Run the independently installed service with `python -m hardware_service.server`, default `127.0.0.1:50051`. `serve()` permits loopback/localhost or Unix sockets only. The browser never accesses it directly. Bindings come from installed Contracts; this product performs no generation. Genuine bounded digital NCAP is carried in `OperationReply.capture_payload`, separate from metadata-only `result_json`.

## Build and verify

Use Node 22 and Python 3.12 in CI; Python >=3.11 is supported. Begin with an external Python environment and reviewed Contracts/DEV and Simulator artifact manifests. See [verification policy](docs/VERIFICATION.md). The complete third-party runtime/test/build closure is SHA256 locked in `requirements-verification.lock`; first-party wheels have separately reviewed version/digest manifests. The former `dev` code-generation extra is replaced by `test`: consumer tests import installed RPC bindings and never compile canonical Contracts.

CI accepts exact immutable HTTPS artifact URLs plus SHA256 repository variables and optional `NETCIRCUIT_ARTIFACTS_READ_TOKEN`. Only GitHub release-asset API requests receive credentials; redirects do not. Missing pins fail closed. It downloads the locked closure, installs it offline, builds wheel/sdist without PEP 517 network isolation, force-installs the selected Hardware archive, checks version/RECORD/digest/import provenance and runs tests from an external CWD. The pytest prepend mode exposes only test-local helpers for real spawn imports; it does not expose product source. No automatic publication occurs. Hosted CI access and execution are separate evidence.

## Compatibility and rollback

The eight non-version runtime modules preserve Remote revision `0d038c7aed15798696223558b4e58f5ffe926aa9` byte-for-byte; only package `__version__` becomes 0.1.1. Graph 1.0/1.1/1.2, RPC 2.0, NCAP v1, station/instrument semantics and Simulator backend identity remain unchanged. Logical FPGA scaffold and physical ABI are independent version domains.

Rollback stops admission, drains/Stops through acknowledged safe cleanup or quarantine, restores the prior compatible Hardware/Contracts/Simulator wheels and consumer pins, then restarts the service. Keep database, captures, leases and quarantine; never replay Start. Package rollback in an isolated environment does not prove electrical shutdown or live deployment. Original source and history remain preserved in Remote; target ancestry connection, staging, commits, merges and publication require separate authorization.
